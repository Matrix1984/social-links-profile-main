### What I learned

I have learned how to build a responsive design using media queries.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
  @media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
      .wrapper {
        width: 20%;
      }
    }
```
  

### Continued development

In the future I will experiment with more CSS units in order to achieve a more precise design that will fit all browsers.


### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for my media queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
